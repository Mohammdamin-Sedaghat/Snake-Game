<h2>Welcome to Snake Futuristica!üêç</h2>
In this game, I decided to create a futuristic version of the snake game!üîÆ

I explored many different concepts of Javascript, and CSS throughout the development of this game. <img src='./images/icons/JS.svg' alt="JS" width="20px"> <img src='./images/icons/CSS.svg' alt="CSS" width="20px"> <img src='./images/icons/HTML.svg' alt="HTML" width="20px">

<strong>Snake Futuristica</strong> has many features, but the most important ones are:

* The option to add blocks. 
* A local Leaderbaord so that you can always know whos the best between your friend group. 
* Smooth Controls over the snake using WASD
* The best Graphics a Snake Game has ever seen!
* Details, Details, and Details!
    * faint glow of the apples and barries.
    * changing of colors of the grid as the snake moves.
    * Box shadows and text shadows which give a futuristic vibe.

<h3>Challenges I faced</h3>
<hr>

* At first, I was not familiar with Canvas, and how it works, so I was planning on implementing the game using div tags! However, I decided to do a bit of research, and found out the magic of the Canvas tag. (which you can see the cool stuff that I made while learning here: [Canvas Cool Stuff!](https://github.com/Mohammdamin-Sedaghat/Random-Side-Projects/tree/main/Canvas%20cool%20stuff))

* Another Challenge I faced was that this was the first time working with game logic in JavaScript, so learning game theory and logic was an intresting feat.
