<h3>Challenges I Faced</h3>
<hr>

* **Learning the Canvas API:**  
Initially, I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the `<canvas>` element and considered implementing the game using `<div>` tags. However, after doing some research, I discovered the magic of the Canvas API. (Check out the cool projects I created while learning: [Canvas Cool Stuff!](https://github.com/Mohammdamin-Sedaghat/Random-Side-Projects/tree/main/Canvas%20cool%20stuff))  

* **Developing Game Logic:**  
This project marked my first experience with game logic in JavaScript. Learning the principles of game theory and implementing them was a challenging yet rewarding journey.
