<h2>Welcome to Snake Futuristica üêç!</h2>
In this game, I decided to create a futuristic version of the snake game!üîÆ

I explored many different concepts of Javascript, and CSS throughout the development of this game. <svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>JavaScript</title><path d="M0 0h24v24H0V0zm22.034 18.276c-.175-1.095-.888-2.015-3.003-2.873-.736-.345-1.554-.585-1.797-1.14-.091-.33-.105-.51-.046-.705.15-.646.915-.84 1.515-.66.39.12.75.42.976.9 1.034-.676 1.034-.676 1.755-1.125-.27-.42-.404-.601-.586-.78-.63-.705-1.469-1.065-2.834-1.034l-.705.089c-.676.165-1.32.525-1.71 1.005-1.14 1.291-.811 3.541.569 4.471 1.365 1.02 3.361 1.244 3.616 2.205.24 1.17-.87 1.545-1.966 1.41-.811-.18-1.26-.586-1.755-1.336l-1.83 1.051c.21.48.45.689.81 1.109 1.74 1.756 6.09 1.666 6.871-1.004.029-.09.24-.705.074-1.65l.046.067zm-8.983-7.245h-2.248c0 1.938-.009 3.864-.009 5.805 0 1.232.063 2.363-.138 2.711-.33.689-1.18.601-1.566.48-.396-.196-.597-.466-.83-.855-.063-.105-.11-.196-.127-.196l-1.825 1.125c.305.63.75 1.172 1.324 1.517.855.51 2.004.675 3.207.405.783-.226 1.458-.691 1.811-1.411.51-.93.402-2.07.397-3.346.012-2.054 0-4.109 0-6.179l.004-.056z"/></svg>

<h4>Features</h4>
<hr>
<bold>Snake Futuristica</bold> has many features, but the most important ones are:
1. Ability to change speed and the block size. 
2. The option to add blocks. 
3. A local Leaderbaord so that you can always know whos the best between your friend group. 

<h4>Challenges I faced</h4>
1. At first, I was not familiar with Canvas, and how it works, so I was planning on implementing the game using div tags! However, I decided to do a bit of research, and found out the magic of the Canvas tag. (which you can see the cool stuff that I made while learning here: [a link](https://github.com/Mohammdamin-Sedaghat/Random-Side-Projects/tree/main/Canvas%20cool%20stuff))

2. Another Challenge I faced was that this was the first time working with game logic in JavaScript, so learning game theory and logic was an intresting feat.
