<h2>Snake Game!</h2>
In this game, I decided to create a futuristic version of the snake game!

I explored many different concepts of Javascript, and CSS throughout the development of this game. 

<h4>Challenges I faced</h4>
At first, I was not familiar with Canvas, and how it works, so I was planning on implementing the game using div tags! However, I decided to do a bit of research, and found out the magic of the Canvas tag. (which you can see the cool stuff that I made while learning here: )
