<h2>Welcome to Snake Futuristica üêç!</h2>
In this game, I decided to create a futuristic version of the snake game!üîÆ

I explored many different concepts of Javascript, and CSS throughout the development of this game. ![JS.svg](./images/JS.svg)

<h4>Features</h4>
<hr>
<bold>Snake Futuristica</bold> has many features, but the most important ones are:
1. Ability to change speed and the block size. 
2. The option to add blocks. 
3. A local Leaderbaord so that you can always know whos the best between your friend group. 

<h4>Challenges I faced</h4>
<hr>
1. At first, I was not familiar with Canvas, and how it works, so I was planning on implementing the game using div tags! However, I decided to do a bit of research, and found out the magic of the Canvas tag. (which you can see the cool stuff that I made while learning here: [a link](https://github.com/Mohammdamin-Sedaghat/Random-Side-Projects/tree/main/Canvas%20cool%20stuff))

2. Another Challenge I faced was that this was the first time working with game logic in JavaScript, so learning game theory and logic was an intresting feat.
